## Overview

This document defines the complete build plan for Nimble S.T.A.R.S, organized into deployable phases. Each phase results in a testable increment. Each task maps to a Linear issue with detailed instructions for Claude Code execution.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Convex (database + server functions + realtime)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (email/password)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (files, logos)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)

### Conventions

- **Language**: All code, comments, commit messages, and branch names in English
- **Branch naming**: `feature/<linear-issue-id>-<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/NIM-12-setup-nextjs`)
- **Commits**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`)
- **File structure**: Follow Next.js App Router conventions (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `convex/`)

### Claude Code Workflow Per Task

For every Linear issue, Claude Code must follow this workflow:

```
1. Move the Linear issue to "In Progress"
2. Create a new git branch: feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>
3. Execute the task as described in the issue
4. Run linting and type-checking (npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit)
5. Commit with conventional commit message referencing the issue
6. Add a comment on the Linear issue with:
   - What was done (summary)
   - How it was done (approach/decisions)
   - Any issues encountered
   - Tokens used (if available)
   - Time taken
7. Merge branch into main
8. Move the Linear issue to "Done"
```

## Phase 1: Project Foundation

**Goal**: Set up the project skeleton with Next.js, Convex, Supabase, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui. Deploy a "Hello World" to Vercel. Testable: the app loads at a URL.

### Task 1.1: Initialize Next.js Project

Create a new Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript and App Router.

```
- npx create-next-app@latest nimble-stars --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
- Verify the project runs locally (npm run dev)
- Initialize git repository
- Create .gitignore (include .env.local, node_modules, .next, .convex)
- Create initial README.md with project name and description
```

### Task 1.2: Configure Tailwind + shadcn/ui

Set up the design system foundation.

```
- Install and initialize shadcn/ui (npx shadcn-ui@latest init)
- Configure Tailwind with custom theme extending default:
  - Colors: nimble brand palette (see Design System below)
  - Font: Inter via next/font/google
  - CSS variables for client theming (--client-primary, etc.)
- Install base shadcn components: Button, Card, Input, Badge, Table, Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Avatar, Textarea, Select, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Separator, ScrollArea
- Create a globals.css with CSS variable definitions
- Create a test page at /design-system showing all installed components (for visual verification)
```

Design system variables to include:
```css
:root {
  --nimble-black: #0A0A0A;

  - convex/candidatePositions.ts: listByCandidate(candidateId) → positions with org info and stage
```

### Task 3.4: Assign Candidate to Position

```
- Dialog/sheet component triggered from candidate detail:
  - Step 1: Select client (dropdown of organizations)
  - Step 2: Select position (dropdown of open positions for selected client)
  - Step 3: Confirm → creates CandidatePosition with stage "submitted"
  - Also creates an activity log entry: "Admin assigned [candidate] to this position"
- Validation: prevent duplicate assignment (same candidate + same position)
- Convex mutations:
  - convex/candidatePositions.ts: assign({ candidateId, positionId })
  - convex/activityLog.ts: create({ action: "assigned", userId, userName, candidatePositionId })
```

### Task 3.5: Admin Position Pipeline View

  - Kanban view:
    - 4 columns: Submitted | To Interview | Approved | Rejected
    - Candidate cards with: initials avatar, name, current role, comment count, last interaction
    - Drag & drop to change stage (updates candidatePosition + creates activity log)
    - Click card → navigate to candidate profile in position context
  - List view:
    - Table: name, stage (badge), date added, last interaction
    - Sortable by date added and last interaction
    - Filterable by stage

  - convex/activityLog.ts: listByPosition(positionId)
- Convex mutations:
  - convex/candidatePositions.ts: updateStage(id, { stage, userId, userName })
  - This mutation should also: update lastInteractionAt, create activity log entry
```

### Task 3.6: Deploy Phase 3

```
- Merge all Phase 3 branches into main
- Deploy to Vercel
- Test end-to-end:
  - Admin creates candidates with files
  - Admin assigns candidates to positions in different clients

  - Drag & drop changes stage and creates activity log
  - Candidate detail shows all assigned positions
  - Manatal links are visible and functional
```

---

## Phase 4: Client Portal

**Goal**: Clients can log in, see their branded portal, browse positions, review candidates, leave comments, change stages, and see activity history. Testable: a client user logs in, sees their branding, interacts with candidates.

### Task 4.1: Client Positions List

```
- Create app/(dashboard)/(client)/positions/page.tsx:
  - List of open positions for the logged-in user's organization
  - Each position card shows: title, candidate count, breakdown by stage (mini badges)
  - Click → navigate to position pipeline
  - Only positions with status "open" are shown
  - Client branding applied (logo in sidebar, primary color on accents)
- Convex queries:
  - convex/positions.ts: listOpenByOrg(orgId) → positions with candidate counts per stage
```

### Task 4.2: Client Pipeline View (Kanban + List)

    - On drop: update stage + create activity log + update lastInteractionAt
    - Click card → navigate to candidate profile
  - List view:
    - Table: name, current role, stage (colored badge), date added, last interaction
    - Filter by stage (dropdown or tabs at top)
    - Sort by: date added (default, newest first) or last interaction
    - Click row → navigate to candidate profile
- Convex queries:
  - convex/candidatePositions.ts: listByPositionForClient(positionId, orgId) → only if position belongs to org and is open
- Convex mutations:
  - convex/candidatePositions.ts: updateStage(id, { stage, userId, userName }) — same mutation as admin, with permission check
```

### Task 4.3: Client Candidate Profile

```
- Create app/(dashboard)/(client)/positions/[id]/candidates/[cid]/page.tsx:
  - Candidate header: initials avatar (large), full name, current role @ company
  - Contact info: email, phone (with copy-to-clipboard)
  - Summary section

  - Current stage: prominent badge + dropdown to change stage
  - Stage change → creates activity log entry
  - NO Manatal link (hidden from client)
  - Two tabs or sections below:
    - Comments
    - Activity History
```

### Task 4.4: Comments System

```
- Comments component (reusable, used in candidate profile):
  - List of existing comments, newest first
  - Each comment shows: user name, initials avatar, comment body, relative timestamp
  - "Add comment" textarea at top with submit button
  - Comments are scoped to CandidatePosition (same candidate in different positions has separate comments)
  - All users in the same organization see all comments (collaborative)
  - Admin sees all comments for any org
- On new comment:
  - Create comment record
  - Create activity log entry ("X left a comment")
  - Update lastInteractionAt on CandidatePosition
- Convex mutations:
  - convex/comments.ts: create({ body, userId, candidatePositionId })
  - convex/comments.ts: listByCandidatePosition(candidatePositionId)
```

### Task 4.5: Activity History Component

```
- Activity history component (reusable, used in candidate profile):
  - Timeline of all activity for this CandidatePosition
  - Entry types:
    - Stage change: "[User] moved [Candidate] from [Stage A] to [Stage B] — [timestamp]"
    - Comment: "[User] left a comment — [timestamp]"
    - Assignment: "[Admin] assigned [Candidate] to this position — [timestamp]"
  - Ordered newest first
  - Timestamps as relative ("2 hours ago") with absolute on hover tooltip
  - Immutable — no edit/delete
- Convex queries:
  - convex/activityLog.ts: listByCandidatePosition(candidatePositionId)
```

### Task 4.6: Client Branding Integration

```
- Ensure dynamic theming works end-to-end:
  - On client login, fetch organization data (primaryColor, logoUrl)
  - Inject --client-primary CSS variable into the client layout
  - Sidebar shows client logo (fallback to Nimble logo if not set)
  - Buttons, links, focus rings, and badges use --client-primary
  - Stage colors remain fixed (blue, amber, green, red) regardless of client branding
- Test with at least 2 different client orgs with different colors and logos
```

### Task 4.7: Deploy Phase 4

```
- Merge all Phase 4 branches into main
- Deploy to Vercel
- Test end-to-end:
  - Client logs in → sees their branding
  - Client browses open positions
  - Client views kanban and list views
  - Client drags candidate to new stage → activity log updates
  - Client opens candidate profile → sees all data, files, comments
  - Client leaves a comment → visible to other users in same org
  - Activity history shows complete timeline
  - A different client logs in → sees only their data, different branding
  - Admin can see all activity from both clients
```

---

## Phase 5: Notifications & Polish

**Goal**: Admin gets notified of client actions. UI/UX polish, edge cases, error handling. Testable: full end-to-end workflow with multiple clients, notifications, and polished UI.

### Task 5.1: In-App Notifications for Admin

```
- Create convex/notifications.ts:
  - Schema: { type, message, isRead, userId (admin), relatedCandidatePositionId?, createdAt }
  - Types: "stage_change", "new_comment"
  - Auto-created when:
    - A client user changes a candidate's stage
    - A client user leaves a comment
  - Query: listUnread(userId) → unread notifications
  - Mutation: markAsRead(id), markAllAsRead(userId)
- Create components/notifications/notification-bell.tsx:
  - Bell icon in header/sidebar with unread count badge
  - Click → dropdown with recent notifications
  - Each notification: message, timestamp, link to relevant candidate profile
  - "Mark all as read" action
  - Uses Convex realtime subscription (updates live)
```

### Task 5.2: Empty States & Loading States

```
- Add proper empty states for:
  - No clients yet (admin)
  - No positions yet (admin client detail / client portal)
  - No candidates in a position
  - No comments on a candidate
  - No activity log entries
  - No files uploaded for a candidate
- Each empty state: friendly illustration or icon + helpful message + CTA where applicable
- Add loading skeletons (shadcn Skeleton) for:
  - Tables
  - Kanban columns
  - Candidate profile sections
  - Cards
```

### Task 5.3: Error Handling & Edge Cases

```
- Handle and test edge cases:
  - User tries to access a position that belongs to another org → 404 or redirect
  - User tries to access a closed position (client) → 404 or redirect to positions
  - Admin closes a position while client is viewing it → realtime update, show message
  - Duplicate candidate assignment prevention (same candidate + same position)
  - File upload failure → error message, retry option
  - Network error during stage change → optimistic UI with rollback
  - Session expiry → redirect to login with message
- Create app/not-found.tsx — Custom 404 page
- Create app/error.tsx — Custom error boundary
- Add toast notifications (shadcn Toast) for:
  - Successful actions (stage change, comment added, candidate created, etc.)
  - Error messages
```

### Task 5.4: Responsive Design Polish

```
- Test and fix all pages on mobile viewports (375px, 390px, 414px):
  - Login page: centered, full width form
  - Sidebar: collapses to hamburger menu or bottom navigation
  - Kanban: horizontal scroll on mobile, or switch to stacked cards
  - Tables: horizontal scroll or card-based layout on mobile
  - Candidate profile: stacked sections
  - Dialogs/sheets: full screen on mobile
- Test on tablet (768px, 1024px):
  - Sidebar: collapsible
  - Kanban: fits all 4 columns or scrolls gracefully
```

### Task 5.5: Performance Optimization

```
- Review and optimize:
  - Convex queries: ensure proper indexes on frequently queried fields (orgId, positionId, candidateId, stage)
  - Add Convex indexes in schema.ts for:
    - positions by orgId
    - candidatePositions by positionId
    - candidatePositions by candidateId
    - comments by candidatePositionId
    - activityLog by candidatePositionId
    - users by orgId
    - users by supabaseUserId
  - Image optimization: use next/image for logos
  - Lazy load file previews
  - Pagination for large lists (candidates bank, activity log)
- Target: page load < 2 seconds on 3G connection
```

### Task 5.6: Seed Data Script

```
- Create scripts/seed.ts:
  - Creates 2-3 sample organizations with different colors/logos
  - Creates admin user and client users for each org
  - Creates positions for each org
  - Creates candidates with sample data
  - Assigns candidates to positions with various stages
  - Creates sample comments and activity log entries
- Purpose: easy demo and testing setup
- Run with: npx convex run scripts/seed
```

## Appendix C: Claude Code Workflow Template

Every time Claude Code picks up a Linear issue, it should follow this exact workflow:

```bash
# 1. Update Linear issue status to "In Progress"
# (via Linear API or MCP)

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/<ISSUE-ID>-<short-description>

# 3. Do the work as described in the issue
# ... write code, create files, install packages ...

# 4. Verify quality
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build  # ensure it builds

# 5. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(<scope>): <description> [<ISSUE-ID>]"

# 6. Push and merge
git push origin feature/<ISSUE-ID>-<short-description>
git checkout main
git merge feature/<ISSUE-ID>-<short-description>
git push origin main

# 7. Comment on Linear issue with:
# - Summary of what was done
# - Technical approach and decisions made
# - Issues encountered (if any)
# - Tokens used: <number>
# - Time taken: <duration>

# 8. Update Linear issue status to "Done"
```
